NNSIGHT SELFIE 
here is the description - summarirse it 
A model-agnostic implementation of the selfie library using NNsight for neural network interpretation.

Overview
This library extends the original selfie approach to work with any transformer model architecture through NNsight's universal interface. While the original selfie was designed specifically for LLaMA models, our implementation provides the same interpretation capabilities across GPT, BERT, T5, and other transformer architectures.

Key Features
Model Agnostic: Works with GPT, LLaMA, BERT, T5, and other transformer models
Cross-Platform: Automatic device detection (MPS, CUDA, CPU)
Activation Extraction: Extract activations from any layer and token position
Activation Injection: Inject activations during generation to steer model behavior
Vector Arithmetic: Perform concept arithmetic like "King - Man + Woman = Queen"
Flexible Interpretation: Create custom interpretation prompts with placeholders
Batch Processing: Efficiently process multiple interpretations
Analysis Tools: Utilities for activation analysis, similarity computation, and vector projections
