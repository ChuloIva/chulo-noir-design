about me section:

Hey, I'm Ivan 👋
I'm a cognitive scientist and AI researcher based in Zagreb Croatia, finished MA in Applied Cognitive Science. My thing is figuring out how AI systems "think" especially when it comes to psychology, mental health, and making these models actually useful for people.
Most of my work sits at this interesting intersection of machine learning and psychology/cognitive science. Using mechanistic interpretability to explore the model internals. {add here correct info about the two projects, so one we tried to see how do models responds to interventions and see do they follow the same patterns as humans based on SDT theory, in another - TOM we've decomposed ToM and analysed the models that are better at ToM what processing is hapenning underneeth using linear probes trained on model activations}
{add also that I've published my work at big conference - the TOM one - like AAAI(maybe add a link to the workshop - https://aaai.org/conference/aaai/aaai-26/workshop-program-list/#ws07 )}
On the more applied side, I build things. I've put together therapeutic AI systems that analyze therapy sessions in real-time, adapted SAEs for discovering cognitive markers of depression , and built various multi-agent systems for psychological assessment. I also enjoy the weirder side projects — like a Bluesky bot that simulates polarized political debates, or automated Twitter bots that tap into trending topics.
Day-to-day, I work across the full stack: fine-tuning models, prompt engineering, evaluation pipelines, LangChain/CrewAI agent architectures, and a lot of data visualization. Previously led AI work at a wellness company where I built LLM-powered feedback systems.
I am interested a lot in AI safety and alignment so Red teaming, evaluation methodologies, understanding what's happening under the hood is all things I like to occupy my mental space with.

also add that I am a member of PALS lab at JHU as a research student affiliate maybe also add a link https://pals-research-lab.github.io/ -
